          <p class="card-text">These noodles are saucy, spicy, a little bit sweet, and full of umami. They’re extra garlicky and vegan! Of course, you can add extra protein and veggies to this to bulk it up and make it a whole meal. These noodles are super versatile and the best part is that they come together amazingly quickly.

            We love noodles. So much that we wrote a whole book dedicated to noodles. We never tire of eating and making noodles at home and we’re always noodling around with new recipes. This is one of our classic go-tos: a super simple umami packed sauce with wide chewy rice noodles. They’re ready in under 15 minutes and are full of flavor.</p>
